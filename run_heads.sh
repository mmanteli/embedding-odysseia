#full_docs_NA="Those looking to enjoy historic motorsport one last time this year should definitely drop by the Francorchamps circuit between Friday 30 September and Sunday 2 October for the traditional finale to the season: the Spa 6 Hours.\nOrganiser Roadbook will then regale us with the pinnacle of classic motorsport. In collaboration with the Masters Historic organisation, they are bringing several historic motorsport classes to Spa-Francorchamps.\nA race, on Saturday evening, over six hours for GT cars up to 1965 is traditionally the highlight of the poster. There are also Formula 1 cars up to 1985, pre-Grand Prix Cars ( Formula 1 precursors ), historic Formula Junior, the Masters Endurance Legends, the Woodcote & Stirling Moss Trophy, the Masters Gentleman drivers GT and the HTCC ( historic touring cars ).\nThe latter will be joined for the first time this year by our very own Belcar Historic Cup. The Belcar thus also makes its entry into this top weekend for classic motorsport. This mix between the English and Belgian competitors could well make for one of the best posters of the weekend.\nThe “oldies” are also featured in a competition featuring only pre-war models.\nVisitors, who come with their vintage cars, will get a free parking space right next to the circuit.\nThe members of the BEHVA are also back on the scene after two years. They will tour the circuit with more than 60 pre-war cars on September 29. Entry to the circuit is even free on Thursday. Members who only attend the event will also get a discount on the entry ticket.\nWe hope that, after last year’s covid edition, the English teams will now return en masse to our Ardennes and make it a real motorsport party again. And the first reports are also positive: the list of participants for the Spa 6 Hours released today has 96 entries. Among them familiar names such as: Eric Van de Poele, Marino Franchitti, Frank Stippler, Nicolas Minnasien and even an “Ickx”. Not Jacky but daughter Vanina.\nThe Spa Six Hours: not to be missed and from us “warmly” recommended\nSee you in Francorchamps!!!"
#full_docs_NA_sr="Here’s an overview of some of the top games in sports being played on June 22. Today, we’re taking a closer look at five games from Major League Baseball and the NHL Playoffs.\nArizona Diamondbacks vs. San Diego Padres – 4:10 PM ET\nWhat better way to kick off the daily sports bets than with an NL West game. The Diamondbacks, who have had a rough season so far, face off against the 43-27 Padres. Arizona nearly won yesterday’s game, losing 3-2 in the 11th inning. Tonight, they’ll send out Madison Bumgarner and hope he fairs better.\nOpposite of Bumgarner is Mike Clevinger, the 1-0 starting pitcher for the Padres. Clevinger has a 3.79 ERA this season, which is slightly worse than Bumgarner. However, Clevinger does have the batters of the Padres to back him up. This season, Padres batters have an average of .242 compared to Arizona’s .216. We’ll take the Padres to win this one tonight -160.\nColorado Rockies vs. Miami Marlins – 6:40 PM ET\nAnother game that’s definitely worth watching is the Rockies at the Marlins. Yesterday’s game was a high scoring one, with the Marlins winning 9-8. The Rockies have won three of their last five games but still have a record of 30-38 this season. They’ll start the 4-4, Chad Kuhl, on the mound tonight who has an ERA of 3.69.\nThe Marlins will send out their own four-win starting pitcher in Pablo Lopez. Lopez is 4-3 this season with an ERA of 2.85. Considering he has a much better ERA than Kuhl, we’ll give the advantage to the Marlins. However, in terms of batting, the advantage goes to the Rockies who have a .262 average. With that being said, we’ll take the Rockies at +175 tonight.\nChicago Cubs vs. Pittsburgh Pirates – 7:05 PM ET\nThe Cubs have already lost the first two games of the series to the Pittsburgh Pirates. With Chicago’s record at a dangerous 25-43, they desperately need a win. The person they hope will do this for them is Keegan Thompson, who is 6-2 this season. Thompson’s impressive record is backed by a 3.27 ERA. If there’s anyone that can break their slump, it’s Thompson.\nThe Pirates are in for a tough game with Thompson on the mound. They’re sending out Jerad Eickhoff to the mound who has yet to pitch a single game. The Cubs also have an advantage in terms of batting with an average of .242. Although the Pirates won the first two, we think the Cubs take this game.\nColorado Avalanche vs. Tampa Bay Lightning – 8:00 PM ET\nThe Avalanche is leading this series 2-1 at the moment. However, in Game 3, they surrendered six goals to the Lightning, losing the game. Colorado has the chance again tonight to take a 3-1 lead in the series. If they can do that, they’ll force the Lightning up against a wall, which is what they need to do. Relying on their offense is the best bet for the Avalanche.\nConsidering Colorado averages 3.76 goals per game, this shouldn’t be a problem. Still, the way they played in Game 3 was definitely concerning. Brayden Point is still out for the Lightning and RW Nikita Kucherov is on the “day-to-day” list. Look for the Avalanche to take advantage of these injuries and get a win on the road tonight.\nSeattle Mariners vs. Oakland Athletics – 9:40 PM ET\nThe final game we’ll take a look at is the Mariners at the Athletics. This series began yesterday with an 8-2 win for the Mariners. Tonight, Seattle will try to repeat the same performance from the night before. On the mound is George Kirby, the 1-2 RHP with an ERA of 3.56. Although Kirby’s record isn’t great, his ERA is pretty solid.\nSpeaking of solid ERAs, Paul Blackburn will get the start for the Athletics tonight. Blackburn has a record of 6-2 this season with an ERA of 2.26. The big problem for the Athletics is batting, where the team has an average of .210. Look for the Mariners to have a bit of trouble against Blackburn but still pull off the win.\nAll odds are courtesy of Action247 Sportsbook.

#full_docs_OP2="Hell Never Produced a Single Pleasure\nOne of the roots of Christian Hedonism as I have pondered it for the last forty years is C. S. Lewis. Reading Alan Jacobs’ biography, The Narnian has underlined the influence Lewis has had on my thinking.\nHere is a striking sentence about Lewis’s lifelong pursuit: “Lewis’s perpetual task both as a defender of Christianity and as an advocate of medieval literature is to call people to delight” (p. 190).\nOne of his paths to this “perpetual task” was his analysis of the devil’s use of pleasure. Screwtape (speaking for the devil—“Our Father”—in The Screwtape Letters) says to one of his under-devils:\nNever forget that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and satisfying form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy's ground. I know we have won many a soul through pleasure. All the same, it is His invention, not ours. He made the pleasures: all our research so far has not enabled us to produce one. All we can do is encourage the humans to take the pleasures which our Enemy has produced, at times, or in ways, or in degrees, which he has forbidden.... An ever increasing craving for an ever diminishing pleasure is the formula.... To get a man's soul and give him nothing in return—that's what really gladdens Our Father's heart. (quoted in The Narnian, 189)\nThis is an astonishing view of pleasure. Hell has never been able to produce one! It can only misuse the ones that God created—in “times,” “ways,” and “degrees” that God forbids.\nThis means that all the debased enjoyments of the world are echoes of the joys of heaven. The analysis of this is worth a lifetime. And one effect of such an analysis would be to take the notion of “seeker-sensitive” ten miles deeper into Truth. How to penetrate the soul whose every desire is for Heaven while hating Heaven—that is the task.\nSign up to receive a daily digest of new articles from Desiring God."
